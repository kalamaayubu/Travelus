    `Travelus is a modern ride-sharing platform that connects drivers with empty seats to passengers heading the same way. 
    During peak times—like school openings or when public vehicles are full—it provides a reliable alternative. 
    Even outside rush hours, it remains a smart choice: drivers earn from seats that would otherwise go empty by 
    offering rides at a relatively lower cost, and passengers enjoy a smooth, affordable, and reliable journey
