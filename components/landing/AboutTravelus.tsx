          <strong className="text-green-600 opacity-90">Travelus</strong> is a modern ride-sharing platform that connects 
          <strong> drivers with empty seats</strong> to passengers heading the same way. 
          During peak timesâ€”like school openings or when public vehicles are fullâ€”it provides a 
          <strong> reliable alternative</strong>. Even outside rush hours, it remains a 
          <strong className="text-indigo-500 opacity-90"> smart choice</strong>: drivers earn from seats that would otherwise go empty by 
          offering rides at a relatively lower cost, and passengers enjoy a 
          <strong> smooth, affordable, and reliable journey</strong>. In the end, 
          everyone goes home happyðŸ˜‚.
